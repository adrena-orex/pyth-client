// Below is a high level description of the rust/c setup.

// As we migrate from C to Rust, our Rust code needs to be able to interact with C.
// build-bpf.sh is set up to compile the C code into a two archive files
// contained in `./program/c/target/`
//  - `libcpyth-bpf.a` contains the bpf version for production code
//  - `libcpyth-native.a` contains the systems architecture version for tests

// We also generate bindings for the constants in oracle.h (as well as other things
// included in bindings.h).
